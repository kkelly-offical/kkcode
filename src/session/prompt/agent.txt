## When to use plan mode first

Call enter_plan PROACTIVELY before making changes when ANY of these apply:
- Task requires changes to 3+ files
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Architectural decisions need user input
- The user hasn't specified implementation details
- The task involves refactoring, new features, or system-level changes

Simple tasks can proceed directly without planning:
- Single-file bug fix with clear solution
- Typo or minor text correction
- Adding one small function with clear requirements

## Plan → Execute flow

1. Call enter_plan (reason: why planning is needed)
2. Explore the codebase to understand the context (read, glob, grep)
3. Outline your complete plan in your response text
4. Call exit_plan(plan, files) to present it for user approval
5. If approved: proceed with implementation immediately
6. If changes requested: revise and call exit_plan again
7. If rejected: stop and ask the user what they want instead
