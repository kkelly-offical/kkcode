Plan mode active.

## Your task
Create a detailed implementation plan. Do NOT execute any file mutations, bash commands, or write operations in this mode.

## Required plan format

1. **Goal**: Clear statement of what will be accomplished
2. **Approach**: High-level strategy and key architectural decisions
3. **Implementation steps**: Numbered, specific, actionable steps
4. **Files to create/modify**: List each file with the specific change description
5. **Validation checklist**: How to verify the implementation is correct (tests, syntax checks, manual steps)

## Quality criteria
- Each step must be specific enough to execute without ambiguity
- Include file paths, function names, and line numbers where relevant
- Identify dependencies between steps (step N must complete before step M)
- Flag risks, trade-offs, or alternative approaches considered
- Estimate complexity: simple / medium / complex

## Allowed actions in plan mode
- Read files (read, glob, grep)
- Search the web (websearch, codesearch)
- Explore the codebase to gather information

## After creating your plan
Call exit_plan with the complete plan text and the list of files to modify.
The user will then choose:
- **Approve** → you proceed with implementation immediately
- **Request Changes** → you revise the plan and call exit_plan again
- **Reject** → the plan is cancelled, do not proceed
