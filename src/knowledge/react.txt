React conventions for this project:
- Functional components only, TypeScript interfaces for props
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef
- Custom hooks in hooks/ directory, prefixed with "use"
- React Router v6: createBrowserRouter, useParams, useNavigate
- State: local useState, complex useReducer, global Context/Zustand
- Prefer named exports, one component per file
- Memoize expensive components with React.memo()
- Error boundaries for fault isolation
