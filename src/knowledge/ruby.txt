Ruby/Rails conventions for this project:
- MVC: app/controllers/, app/models/, app/views/
- Convention over configuration: naming drives behavior
- ActiveRecord for ORM: migrations, associations, validations, scopes
- RESTful routes: resources :users in config/routes.rb
- Strong parameters for mass assignment protection
- Concerns for shared model/controller logic
- Background jobs: Sidekiq or ActiveJob
- Testing: RSpec preferred, FactoryBot for test data
- Gems via Bundler, Gemfile for dependency management
- Ruby style: snake_case methods, 2-space indent, no semicolons
