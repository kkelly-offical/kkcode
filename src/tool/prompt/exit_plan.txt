Present your completed plan to the user for approval. The user will see the plan and can approve, reject, or request changes.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already outlined your plan in your text response after calling enter_plan
- This tool submits the plan for user review
- The user will see the plan content and the list of files affected

## When to Use
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when planning implementation steps for a task that requires writing code.
For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, or understanding the codebase — do NOT use this tool.

## Before Using This Tool
Ensure your plan is complete and unambiguous:
- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use `question` first
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval
- Do NOT use `question` to ask "Is this plan okay?" — that's exactly what exit_plan does

## Requirements
- You MUST have called enter_plan first
- Your plan must be complete and specific — include file paths, function names, and concrete changes
- Include ALL files that will be created or modified in the `files` parameter

## Parameters
- plan (required): the complete plan text to present to the user
- files (optional): array of file paths that will be created or modified

## User Response
The user will:
- Approve: you proceed with implementation
- Reject: you receive their feedback and should revise
- Provide custom feedback: treat as rejection with specific guidance

## Examples

<good-example>
# Complete plan with structure
plan:
## Context
Adding dark mode toggle to the settings page.

## Approach
Use CSS custom properties for theme switching with React Context for state management.

## Files to modify
- src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx — new context provider
- src/components/Settings/ThemeToggle.tsx — new toggle component
- src/styles/variables.css — add dark theme variables
- src/App.tsx — wrap with ThemeProvider

## Verification
- Toggle switches theme visually
- Theme persists across page refresh (localStorage)
- All existing tests still pass
</good-example>
<bad-example>
# Plan too vague — no files, no specifics
plan: "I'll add dark mode by creating some components and updating styles"
</bad-example>

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT start implementation before receiving approval
- If rejected, address the user's feedback and submit a revised plan
