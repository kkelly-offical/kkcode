Present your completed plan to the user for approval.

REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST have called enter_plan first
- Your plan must be complete and specific — include file paths, function names, and concrete changes
- Include ALL files that will be created or modified in the `files` parameter

The user will see your plan and can:
- Approve: you proceed with implementation
- Reject: you receive their feedback and should revise your approach
- Provide custom feedback: treat as rejection with specific guidance

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT start implementation before receiving approval
- If rejected, address the user's feedback and submit a revised plan
- Keep the plan concise but detailed enough to execute without ambiguity
