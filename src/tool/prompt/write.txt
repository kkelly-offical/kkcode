Write full file content to a target path. Creates the file and parent directories
if they do not exist.

This is the PRIMARY tool for creating new files. When you need to create a new
file (code, config, documentation, etc.), use this tool directly with the
complete file content. Do NOT delegate file creation to `task` — just call
`write` with the path and content.

IMPORTANT:
- Parent directories are created automatically — no need to `mkdir` first.
- Always include the COMPLETE file content in a single `write` call.
  Do NOT split a file across multiple writes or plan to "append later".
- For reading files, use the `read` tool — never use `bash` with cat/type/Get-Content.

Usage:
- path: relative or absolute file path
- content: the complete file content to write
