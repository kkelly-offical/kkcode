Writes a file to the local filesystem. Creates parent directories automatically.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the `read` tool first to read the file's contents.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files with `edit`. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation if explicitly requested by the user.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.

IMPORTANT:
- Parent directories are created automatically — no need to `mkdir` first.
- Always include the COMPLETE file content in a single `write` call. Do NOT split a file across multiple writes or plan to "append later".
- For reading files, use the `read` tool — never use `bash` with cat/type/Get-Content.
- Do NOT use `write` when only a small part of an existing file needs to change — use `edit` instead.
- Do NOT delegate file creation to `task` — just call `write` directly.

Parameters:
- path (required): file path (absolute or relative)
- content (required): the complete file content to write

When to use `write` vs `edit`:
- New file that doesn't exist yet → `write`
- Replacing entire file content → `write` (after reading it first)
- Changing a few lines in an existing file → `edit`
- Renaming a variable across a file → `edit` with replace_all
