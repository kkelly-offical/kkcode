Create and manage a structured task list for tracking multi-step work.

IMPORTANT: For ANY task with 2+ steps, create a todo list IMMEDIATELY before starting.

Workflow:
1. Break task into specific, actionable items
2. Create list with all items as "pending"
3. Mark first item "in_progress" and start working
4. Mark each item "completed" immediately after finishing
5. Add new subtasks as they emerge

Task states: pending, in_progress, completed
Only ONE task should be in_progress at any time.

Parameters:
- todos: Array of objects:
  - content (required): task description in imperative form ("Run tests", "Add validation")
  - status (required): "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"
  - activeForm (optional): present continuous form shown during execution ("Running tests", "Adding validation")
