Create and manage a structured task list for tracking multi-step work. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:
1. Complex multi-step tasks — When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps
2. Non-trivial tasks — Tasks requiring careful planning or multiple operations
3. User provides multiple tasks — When users provide a list of things to be done
4. After receiving new instructions — Immediately capture requirements as todos

## When NOT to Use This Tool
Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking provides no benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States and Management

Task states: pending, in_progress, completed

IMPORTANT — Task descriptions must have two forms:
- content: imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g. "Run tests", "Fix authentication bug")
- activeForm: present continuous form shown during execution (e.g. "Running tests", "Fixing authentication bug")

Rules:
- Update task status in real-time as you work
- Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
- Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones

Task Completion Requirements:
- ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
- If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
- Never mark a task as completed if: tests are failing, implementation is partial, you encountered unresolved errors

Parameters:
- todos (required): array of task objects
  - content (required): task description in imperative form
  - status (required): "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"
  - activeForm (required): present continuous form shown during execution
