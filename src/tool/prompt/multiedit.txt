Apply multiple file edits in a single atomic operation.
All changes succeed together or are rolled back entirely — no half-applied states.

When to use (instead of sequential `edit` calls):
- Renaming an export and updating all its import sites
- Refactoring a function signature and all call sites
- Moving code between files (delete from one, add to another)
- Any change where partial application would break the codebase

Parameters:
- changes (required): array of file operations:
  - path: file path
  - before: text to find (omit to create a new file)
  - after: replacement text (for edits) or full content (for new files)
  - replace_all: replace all occurrences of `before` (default: false)

Rules:
- You MUST `read` each file before editing it (same as `edit` tool).
- If any change fails validation (no match, ambiguous match), the entire batch is rejected before any writes.
- On write failure mid-batch, all previously applied changes are rolled back.
