Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the user provides a path to a file, assume that path is valid.

## Usage

- The path parameter can be absolute or relative to the working directory.
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file. You can optionally specify offset and limit for large files.
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated.
- Results are returned with line numbers in "     1→content" format.

## File Type Support

- **Text files**: All text files are read with line numbers. This is the default behavior.
- **Image files** (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP, BMP, ICO): Returns a base64-encoded data URI that can be visually analyzed. Use this when the user asks you to look at a screenshot or image.
- **PDF files** (.pdf): Extracts text content from PDF pages. For large PDFs (10+ pages), use the `pages` parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g. pages="1-5"). Maximum 20 pages per request.
- **Jupyter notebooks** (.ipynb): Parses the notebook JSON and returns all cells with their type, source, and outputs in a readable format. Combines code, text, and output for easy understanding.

## Critical Rules

- ALWAYS use `read` to view files. NEVER use `bash` with cat/head/tail/type/Get-Content.
- You MUST read a file before editing it with `edit`. Edits on unread files are rejected.
- You can call multiple `read` tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.
- If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at that path.

## Parameters

- path (required): file path (absolute or relative)
- offset (optional): start line number (1-based). Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.
- limit (optional): max lines to return. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.
- encoding (optional): file encoding (default: utf8)
- pages (optional): page range for PDF files (e.g. "1-5", "3", "10-20"). Only applicable to PDF files.

## Tips

- Read the full file first to understand context before editing. Do not provide offset/limit unless necessary.
- For large files (1000+ lines), use offset+limit to read specific sections.
- After a failed edit, re-read the file — it may have changed since your last read.
- Line numbers in output help you locate exact positions for edits.
- When reading multiple related files, read them all in parallel for efficiency.
- When editing text from read output, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + →. Everything after that → is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in edit operations.
