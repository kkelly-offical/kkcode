Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.

Usage:
- The path parameter can be absolute or relative to the working directory.
- By default, it reads the entire file. You can optionally specify offset and limit for large files.
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated.
- Results are returned with line numbers in "     1→content" format.

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS use `read` to view files. NEVER use `bash` with cat/head/tail/type/Get-Content.
- You MUST read a file before editing it with `edit`. Edits on unread files are rejected.
- You can call multiple `read` tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.

Parameters:
- path (required): file path (absolute or relative)
- offset (optional): start line number (1-based). Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.
- limit (optional): max lines to return. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.
- encoding (optional): file encoding (default: utf8)

Tips:
- Read the full file first to understand context before editing. Do not provide offset/limit unless necessary.
- For large files (1000+ lines), use offset+limit to read specific sections.
- After a failed edit, re-read the file — it may have changed since your last read.
- Line numbers in output help you locate exact positions for edits.
- When reading multiple related files, read them all in parallel for efficiency.
