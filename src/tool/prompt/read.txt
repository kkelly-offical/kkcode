Read file content with line numbers. Returns numbered lines in "     1→content" format.

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS use `read` to view files. NEVER use `bash` with cat/head/tail.
- You MUST read a file before editing it with `edit`.
- Lines longer than 2000 characters are automatically truncated.

Parameters:
- path (required): file path
- offset (optional): start line number (1-based)
- limit (optional): max lines to return
- encoding (optional): file encoding (default: utf8)

Tips:
- Read the full file first to understand context before editing.
- For large files (1000+ lines), use offset+limit to read sections.
- After a failed edit, re-read — the file may have changed.
- Line numbers in output help you locate exact positions for edits.
