Search the web for up-to-date information using Exa AI.

IMPORTANT — When to use PROACTIVELY (reduce hallucination):
- You are unsure about a fact, API, library version, or behavior
- The user asks about recent events, releases, or changelogs
- You encounter an unfamiliar error message or deprecation warning
- You need to verify correct syntax or configuration for a specific version
- The topic is beyond your training data cutoff

Do NOT guess when you can search. A quick websearch is always better than a confident hallucination.

Parameters:
- query (required): search query — be specific, include version numbers and context
- numResults (optional): number of results (default: 5)
- type (optional): "auto" (balanced, default), "fast" (quick), "deep" (comprehensive)

Tips:
- Include the year or version in queries for time-sensitive topics (e.g. "React 19 new hooks 2025")
- Use specific error messages as queries when debugging
- Prefer "deep" type for complex research questions
