Search the web for up-to-date information using Exa AI.

IMPORTANT — When to use PROACTIVELY (reduce hallucination):
- You are unsure about a fact, API, library version, or behavior
- The user asks about recent events, releases, or changelogs
- You encounter an unfamiliar error message or deprecation warning
- You need to verify correct syntax or configuration for a specific version
- The topic is beyond your training data cutoff

Do NOT guess when you can search. A quick websearch is always better than a confident hallucination.

Parameters:
- query (required): search query — be specific, include version numbers and context
- numResults (optional): number of results (default: 5)
- type (optional): "auto" (balanced, default), "fast" (quick), "deep" (comprehensive)

## When NOT to Use
- Do NOT search for information you already know with high confidence (basic syntax, well-known APIs).
- Do NOT search when the answer is in the local codebase — use `grep` or `read` first.
- Do NOT search for user-specific context (their business logic, variable names, etc.) — that's in their code.

Tips:
- ALWAYS include the current year in queries for time-sensitive topics (e.g. "React 19 new hooks 2026")
- Use specific error messages as queries when debugging
- Prefer "deep" type for complex research questions
- Include library/framework version numbers when relevant

Examples:
<good-example>
# Debugging an unfamiliar error
websearch query="TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined reading 'map' React 18 2026"
</good-example>
<good-example>
# Checking latest API syntax
websearch query="Next.js 15 app router middleware configuration 2026"
</good-example>
<bad-example>
# Too vague — add specifics
websearch query="how to use React"
# Better: websearch query="React 19 useOptimistic hook example 2026"
</bad-example>

CRITICAL: After answering the user's question with search results, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end with source URLs as markdown hyperlinks so the user can verify the information.
