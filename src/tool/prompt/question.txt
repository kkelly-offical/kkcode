Ask the user one or more structured questions during execution. Use when you need user input to proceed.

## When to Use
- Gather user preferences or requirements
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
- Offer choices about what direction to take

## Parameters
- questions (required): array of question objects (1-4 questions per call)
  - id (required): unique question identifier
  - text (required): the complete question text (should end with ?)
  - description (optional): supplementary explanation
  - options (optional): array of predefined choices (2-4 options)
    - label (required): display text (concise, 1-5 words)
    - value (optional): option value (defaults to label)
    - description (optional): explanation of what this option means
  - multi (optional, default false): allow multiple selections
  - allowCustom (optional, default true): allow custom text input

## Tips
- Users will always be able to provide custom text input regardless of options
- Use multi: true when choices are not mutually exclusive
- If you recommend a specific option, list it first and add "(Recommended)" to its label
- Keep option labels concise and clearly distinct from each other
- In plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this to ask "Is my plan ready?" — use exit_plan for that.
