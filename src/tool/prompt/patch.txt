Replace a range of lines in a file by line number. Transactional with automatic rollback.

Usage:
- You MUST `read` the file first — patches on unread files are rejected.
- Use `read` with offset/limit to view the relevant section, note line numbers, then call `patch`.
- Lines are 1-based and the range is inclusive (both start_line and end_line are replaced).
- To delete lines without replacement, pass content as empty string "".

Parameters:
- path (required): file path
- start_line (required): first line to replace (1-based, inclusive)
- end_line (required): last line to replace (1-based, inclusive)
- content (required): replacement text (replaces the entire line range)

When to use `patch` vs `edit`:
- You know exact line numbers from a recent `read` → use `patch`
- You know exact text to match but not line numbers → use `edit`
- You need to replace many occurrences of a string → use `edit` with replace_all
- You want to replace a large section (50+ lines) → use `patch` (only needs new content, not old)

Workflow for large file modifications:
1. `read` the file (or section with offset/limit)
2. Note the line numbers of the section to change
3. Call `patch` with start_line, end_line, and new content
