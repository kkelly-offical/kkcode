Find files by glob pattern recursively.
Use this to discover project structure and locate files before reading or editing them.
ALWAYS use `glob` instead of `bash` with find/ls/dir.

Parameters:
- pattern (required): glob pattern
- path (optional): directory to search in (default: cwd). Use this to limit search to a subdirectory.

Examples:
- "**/*.mjs" — all .mjs files recursively
- "src/**/*.ts" — TypeScript files under src/
- "*.json" — JSON files in root
- "src/components/**" — everything under components/
- glob pattern="**/*.test.mjs" path="src/tool/" — test files under src/tool/

Returns matching file paths sorted by name. Limited to 200 results.
