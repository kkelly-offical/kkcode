Find files by glob pattern in the current working directory.
Use this to discover project structure and locate files before reading or editing them.

Examples:
- "**/*.mjs" — all .mjs files recursively
- "src/**/*.ts" — TypeScript files under src/
- "*.json" — JSON files in root
- "src/components/**" — everything under components/

Returns matching file paths sorted by name. Limited to 200 results.
