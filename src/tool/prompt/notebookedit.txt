Edit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cell. Supports replace, insert, and delete operations.

Parameters:
- path (required): absolute or relative path to the .ipynb file
- cell_number (optional): 0-indexed cell number to operate on (default: 0)
- new_source (required): new cell source content (ignored for delete)
- cell_type (optional): "code" or "markdown" — required for insert, defaults to existing cell type for replace
- edit_mode (optional): "replace" (default), "insert", or "delete"

Operations:
- replace: Replace the source of cell at cell_number with new_source. Preserves cell type unless cell_type is specified.
- insert: Insert a new cell AFTER cell_number. cell_type is required. If cell_number is -1, inserts at the beginning.
- delete: Remove the cell at cell_number. new_source is ignored but must be provided.

IMPORTANT:
- The notebook must be a valid .ipynb JSON file with a "cells" array.
- cell_number is 0-indexed. The first cell is 0, second is 1, etc.
- For insert mode, cell_type must be specified ("code" or "markdown").
- Cell outputs are preserved during replace; cleared only if cell_type changes to "markdown".
- When inserting code cells, outputs default to an empty array.
- This tool reads the notebook, modifies the cells array, and writes it back atomically.
