- New feature implementation requiring architectural decisions
- Multiple valid approaches exist and user should choose
- Changes affect more than 2-3 files
- The task involves unfamiliar code or unclear requirements
- Refactoring or restructuring existing code

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- Single-line fixes, typo corrections, simple renames
- Tasks with very specific, detailed user instructions
- Pure research or exploration (use task with explore subagent instead)

After calling enter_plan:
1. Outline your plan in your text response
2. List which files will be created or modified
3. Call exit_plan to present the plan to the user for approval
4. Wait for approval before making any code changes
