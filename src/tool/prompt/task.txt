Delegate complex, multi-step work to a subagent that makes its own LLM calls.

# Available subagent types
- subagent_type="explore" — Fast codebase exploration. Use for: finding files, understanding project structure, tracing dependencies. Read-only.
- subagent_type="reviewer" — Code review specialist. Use for: finding bugs, security issues, code quality problems, convention violations. Read-only.
- subagent_type="researcher" — Deep research agent. Use for: investigating unfamiliar libraries, combining local analysis with web search, producing research reports. Read-only with web access.
- (default) — Full-capability agent. Use for: complex multi-file changes, refactoring, test writing.

# WHEN TO USE
- Complex tasks requiring multiple tool calls and autonomous reasoning (e.g. "refactor module X", "write tests for Y")
- Work that benefits from an independent context and session
- Code review, deep research, or codebase exploration that would clutter the main conversation

# WHEN NOT TO USE — use the appropriate tool directly instead:
- Creating or writing files → use `write`
- Modifying existing files → use `edit`
- Running shell commands → use `bash`
- Reading files or searching → use `read`, `grep`, `glob`
- Simple single-step operations → use the appropriate tool

# IMPORTANT
- Each `task` call spawns a full LLM session — it is expensive and slow.
- Do NOT use `task` as a wrapper for simple file operations.
- `run_in_background: true` spawns a separate worker. Only use for truly long-running work.
- Prefer foreground execution unless the task will take many iterations.
- `subagent_type` and `category` are mutually exclusive. Omit both to use the default agent.
