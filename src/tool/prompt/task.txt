Delegate complex, multi-step work to a subagent that makes its own LLM calls.

WHEN TO USE:
- Complex tasks requiring multiple tool calls and autonomous reasoning
  (e.g. "refactor module X", "write comprehensive tests for Y", "migrate codebase from A to B")
- Work that benefits from an independent context and session

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- Creating or writing files → use `write` directly
- Modifying existing files → use `edit` directly
- Running shell commands → use `bash` directly
- Reading files or searching → use `read`, `grep`, `list` directly
- Simple single-step operations of any kind → use the appropriate tool directly

IMPORTANT:
- Each `task` call spawns a full LLM session — it is expensive and slow.
- Do NOT use `task` as a wrapper for simple file operations.
- `run_in_background: true` spawns a separate worker process. Only use this for
  truly long-running work. Background tasks may fail silently if the worker
  process encounters errors.
- Prefer foreground execution (run_in_background: false or omitted) unless the
  task will take many iterations.
- `subagent_type` and `category` are mutually exclusive. Omit both to use the default agent.
